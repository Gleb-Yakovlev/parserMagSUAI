A program that parses data from the GUAPa Master's Degree website page
in the right directions. The program outputs the received data to an Excel spreadsheet.
Data is displayed only on students who submitted the original documents and with priority 1.
The student's line is also added by specifying the SNILS (for those who do not value their
personal data). Thanks to SUAI for developing my skills, if you had written
a normal website with filtering and sorting, you would not have to torment python to
build such a crutch.
